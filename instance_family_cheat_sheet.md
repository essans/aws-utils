## 1. T Family (Burstable Performance)
- Low-cost instances with baseline CPU and ability to burst using credits.
- **CPU credit model**: accrues credits when idle, spends them when bursting. 
- Great price/perf if average CPU is low. 
- **Best for**: small web apps, dev/test, jump-boxes, microservices, low-traffic DBs.  
- **Strengths**: very low-cost; flexible with `unlimited` bursting option.  
- **Examples**: T3, T3a, T4g (Graviton2, ARM).  

## 2. C Family (CPU-optimized)
- Designed for compute-heavy workloads needing high CPU per GB memory. 
- Useful for where CPU is the bottleneck: program spends most time executing instructions.
- Adding more CPU (faster cores, more cores) improves throughput.
- Performance scales linearly when adding cores.
- **Examples**: modelling, video transcoding, compression, simulations, cryptography

## 3. M Family (Memory optimized)
- Provides a balance of CPU, memory, and networking resources.
- Safe "default" choice when unsure about workload profile.
- Best for mixed workloads where neither CPU nor memory is a clear bottleneck.
- Good balance for dev/test and production environments.
- Useful wherelimiting factor is memory capacity or memory bandwidth.
- Adding more CPU doesn’t help much if the process waits on memory access.
- Two flavors: capacity-bound (need more GB) and bandwidth-bound (need faster memory).
- Symptoms: CPU looks low/erratic; CPUs stall waiting for memory fetches.
- **Examples**: in-memory DBs, graph analytics, caching, genomics/bioinformatics.

__Diagnosing CPU vs Memory Bound__
- Measure with system metrics (CloudWatch, htop, vmstat, iostat).
- Symptoms where CPU needed: High CPU utilization near 100% while memory/disk/network IO are fine.
- CPU low, memory huge/swapping → memory-bound.
- Performance improves by adding RAM → memory-bound.
- Performance improves by adding CPU → CPU-bound.
- Useful factory analogy: CPU = workers, Memory = warehouse space + conveyor belts  
-- If too few workers, output limited → CPU-bound.  
-- If too little warehouse space or slow belts, workers idle waiting → memory-bound.


## 4. R, X, High Memory Families
- **R family**: memory-optimized, balance between high RAM and CPU.  
  - **Use cases**: in-memory DBs, big caches, RT analytics.  
- **X / u- instances**: extreme RAM footprint, multi-terabyte options.  
  - **Use cases**: enterprise in-memory workloads.  

---

## 9. I / D / H Families (Storage Optimized)
- **I family** (I3, I4i, Is4gen): NVMe SSDs, very high IOPS, low latency.  
  - **Use cases**: NoSQL DBs, Kafka, ClickHouse, OLTP.  
- **D / H families**: dense HDD storage, high throughput.  
  - **Use cases**: HDFS, log processing, big-data cold/warm tiers.

### G Instances (Graphics / Visualization / Inference)
- Optimized for graphics workloads and light ML inference.  
- **Workloads**: VDI, 3D rendering, game streaming, video encoding/decoding, light inference.

- **Examples**: G4dn (NVIDIA T4), G4ad (AMD Radeon Pro V520), G5 (NVIDIA A10G), G6 (NVIDIA L4).  

### P Instances (GPU Compute / Training)
- Optimized for heavy ML/DL training, large inference, and GPU HPC.  
- **Workloads**: training LLMs, scientific simulations, CUDA workloads.  
- **Strengths**: top-end GPUs (V100, A100, H100), NVLink for scale-out training.  
- **Examples**: P3 (V100), P4d/P4de (A100), P5 (H100).
